Task
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent 
(the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), 
and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) 
for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to 
the nearest integer.


Example
meal_price = 100
tip_percent = 15
tax_percent = 8
A tip of 15% * 100 = 15, and the taxes are 8% * 100 = 8. 
Print the value  and return from the function.

meal_prices = meal_price + tip_percent + tax_percent
